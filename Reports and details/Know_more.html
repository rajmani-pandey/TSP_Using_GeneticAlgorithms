                <h3> <b>What is Travelling Salesman Problem or TSP? </b> </h3>
                <p>The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that
                    seeks to find the shortest possible route a salesperson can take to visit a set of cities and return
                    to the starting city, visiting each city exactly once. It is called the "traveling salesman" problem
                    because it can be visualized as a salesperson trying to minimize the distance traveled while
                    visiting multiple cities to sell their products.
                    The problem is considered an NP-hard problem, which means that finding the optimal solution for
                    large instances becomes computationally challenging as the number of cities increases.
                    Mathematically, the TSP is represented as a complete weighted graph, where each city represents a
                    node, and the distances between cities represent the weights on the edges. The goal is to find a
                    Hamiltonian cycle, a path that visits each city once and returns to the starting city, with the
                    minimum possible total distance.

                    <b>Scope and Real World Applications of TSP:</b> 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    TSP is an NP hard problem in combinatorial optimization important in operations research and
                    theoretical computer science. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is always fascinating for the
                    computational scientists and poses interesting challenges to formulate fast and effective algorithms
                    for its solution. It is really challenging to design a robust and effective algorithm, which can
                    give optimal solutions to TSP with large dimensions. There are many algorithms proposed in the
                    literature based on various branches of mathematics, graph theory, operation research and even in
                    fuzzy theory. The amount of computational time to solve this problem grows exponentially as the
                    number of cities. These problems demand innovative solutions if they are to be solved within a
                    reasonable amount of time. We are trying to explore the solution of the Travelling Salesman Problem
                    using genetic algorithms. The aim of the project is to review how genetic algorithms are applied to
                    this problem and find an efficient solution.
                    <br>
                    The TSP has many real-world applications, such as <strong> routing in logistics, transportation, network
                    design, circuit board drilling, and DNA sequencing.</strong> It remains an active area of research in both
                    theoretical computer science and applied mathematics.

                <h3><b>What is Genetics Algorithm?</b></h3>
                <p>A genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection
                    and genetics. It is commonly used to solve optimization and search problems where traditional
                    algorithms may be inefficient or impractical. Genetic algorithms are particularly useful for solving
                    complex problems that involve a large search space.
                    Genetic algorithms have been applied to a wide range of problems, including optimization,
                    scheduling, data mining, machine learning, and engineering design. They provide a powerful and
                    flexible approach for solving challenging optimization problems by leveraging principles from
                    evolutionary biology.

                <p>
                    1. [Start] Generate a random population of n chromosomes (suitable solutions for the
                    problem)
                    <br>
                    2. [Fitness] Evaluate the fitness f(x) of each chromosome x in the population.
                    <br>
                    3. [New population] Create a new population by repeating the following steps until the new
                    population is complete.<br>
                    4. [Selection] Select two parent chromosomes from a population according to their fitness
                    (the better fitness, the bigger chance to be selected). <br>
                    5. [Crossover] is performed with a probability known as crossover probability that crossover
                    the selected parents to produce a new offspring (children). If crossover probability is 0%,
                    children are an exact copy of the parents.<br>
                    6. [Mutation] is performed with a probability known as mutation probability that mutates
                    new offspring at each locus (position in chromosome).<br>
                    7. [Accepting] Place new offspring in a new population. <br>
                    . 8. [Replace] Use the newly generated population for running the algorithm. <br>
                    9. [Test] If the termination condition is satisfied, then stop the algorithm, and return the best
                    solution in the current population. <br>
                    10. [Loop] Go to step 2.<br>
